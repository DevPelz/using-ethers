# Using Ethers JS

I wrote a script to retrieve the transaction count and balance for a wallet address on Ethereum mainnet in the ` index.js ` file. Here's a general outline of how you can achieve this:

- Use the [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Install ethers.js: 
```bash
 npm install ethers 
 ```
- run the code using: 
```bash
node index.js
```

I also wrote a script that retrieves token information from its contract address in Ethereum network, I used the `ethers.js` library and you can interact with the ERC-20 token contract by calling its methods to get details like name, symbol and total suppply. You can also run this by repeating the above steps to run the code in the `script.js` file.
